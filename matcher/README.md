# Raster Image Feature Matching with LoFTR

This project demonstrates feature matching between raster images (JP2 format) using **LoFTR** and **Kornia**. The solution reads Sentinel-2 raster images, resizes them, and detects matches between keypoints with confidence filtering and fundamental matrix estimation.
